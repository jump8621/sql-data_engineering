The historgram shows the common salary ranges for the employees of the store. The histogram clearly demostates that the most common salary range is $40,000 to 50,000. 

When investigating further:

  $48,681 is found to be 50% of the salary range,
  $61,758 is 75%,

  Which shows the salary range for the store is skewed toward the lower end, a lot of lower paid employees working for a couple high paid bosses.
